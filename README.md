## Description
Detecting defects in manufacturing processes in typically performed manually. In this repository, we explore computer vision methods to detect different classes of steel defects using a dataset provided by [Severstal](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/severstal-steel-defect-detection/data). See our presentation provided in the repository for an intitial project pitch.
